    "## Code Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository provides a complete toolchain for understanding and reproducing our key results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Physics-Informed Data Generation:** A Python script that generates a realistic, synthetic dataset of 1,000 PLL frequency waveforms. This model incorporates multiple physical noise sources (phase noise, thermal drift, supply ripple) to closely match the behavior of measured silicon.\n",
    "2.  **Hardware-Aware Training (HAT) Model:** A simplified but functional PyTorch implementation of the `stochastic_forward_pass` function, which models the key non-idealities (ReRAM variability, IR drop, readout noise) of the analog in-memory compute core.\n",
    "3.  **Reproducible Jitter Analysis:** An interactive Jupyter Notebook that:\n",
    "    *   Loads the generated raw data.\n",
    "    *   Calculates the RMS Period Jitter for each of the 1,000 waveforms.\n",
    "    *   Generates a histogram of the results, quantitatively validating the **19.8 fs** typical RMS jitter reported in the main manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repository Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`/notebooks/`**: The best place to start. Contains interactive Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "    *   `reproduce_jitter_histogram.ipynb`: **(Recommended)** Step-by-step validation of the key **19.8 fs RMS jitter** result.\n",
    "    *   `RICC-HAT_Interactive_Tutorial.ipynb`: A conceptual tutorial explaining the HAT methodology.\n",
    "*   **`/data/`**: Target directory for raw experimental data.\n",
    "    *   `/raw_data/`: This directory is created by the data generation script.\n",
    "*   **`/src/`**: Contains core Python library code.\n",
    "*   **`/scripts/`**: Contains standalone scripts.\n",
    "    *   `generate_raw_data.py`: Generates the realistic synthetic dataset.\n",
    "    *   `adc_design_specs.py`: Programmatically generates the 8-bit SAR ADC design specifications.\n",
    "*   **`PDK_and_MODEL_NOTES.md`**: Provides simplified, high-level behavioral models (SPICE, Verilog) and notes on our verification methodology.\n",

    "## Quickstart: Reproducing the Key Jitter Result\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure full reproducibility, we recommend using a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Environment:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Clone the repository\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ahmadjadery/A-Self-Improving-Microsystem-Enabled-by-a-Cognitive-Reinforcement-Learning-Core.git\n",
    "cd A-Self-Improving-Microsystem-Enabled-by-a-Cognitive-Reinforcement-Learning-Core\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and activate virtual environment\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install required packages\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Generate Raw Data:**\n",
    "Run the following command from the root directory to generate the `stress_test_TT_corner_1000_runs.csv` file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python scripts/generate_raw_data.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Run the Verification Notebook:**\n",
    "Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `notebooks/reproduce_jitter_histogram.ipynb`. Run all cells to generate the histogram and verify the final result.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
