# RICC-HAT: Code for "Resilience that Learns"

This repository provides the official implementation for the paper "[Your Final Title Here]", published in *Nature Electronics*. It includes a simplified Python implementation of the Hardware-Aware Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (HA-TD3) algorithm and an interactive Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate the core principles of Hardware-Aware Training (HAT).

## Overview

The key contribution of our work is a **Hardware-Aware Training (HAT)** methodology that creates resilient and self-improving cognitive agents by embedding a model of the physical hardware's non-idealities directly into the training loop. This repository provides a simplified, functional demonstration of this concept.

## Repository Structure

-   `/src/`: Contains the core Python scripts for the HA-TD3 agent and the training loop.
-   `/data/`: Contains a simplified dataset representing the host PLL environment.
-   `RICC-HAT_Interactive_Tutorial.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step tutorial on the HAT methodology and allows users to run a simplified training experiment.

## Getting Started

To get started, we recommend opening and running the `RICC-HAT_Interactive_Tutorial.ipynb` notebook. It requires a standard Python environment with the following libraries:

-   PyTorch
-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
`pip install torch numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter`
