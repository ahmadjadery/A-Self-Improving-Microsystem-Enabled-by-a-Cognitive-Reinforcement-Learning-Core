"""
Generates the definitive, peer-review-ready design specification dictionary
for the high-performance 8-bit SAR ADC core within the RICC project,
targeting a 28nm CMOS process.

This script serves as a formal, reproducible design document. All parameters are
calculated based on first-principles and state-of-the-art design methodologies,
consistent with the data presented in the main manuscript and supplementary notes.
